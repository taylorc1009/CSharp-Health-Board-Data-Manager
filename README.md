# CSharp-Health-Board-Data-Manager

## Edinburgh Napier University Coursework

An application built to validate, store and retreive data about staff, clients and staff visits to clients.

It utilizes the #design patterns: factory and decorator#.

Data is held in serialized binary files, but if you have Microsoft SQL Server installed you can create a database using the SQL files provided and remove the commented out code in the DataLayer.

Development constraints:
- We were not permitted to alter the PresentationLayer. It was provided to us by our examiner from the beginning to work off of, and editting it meant we could forge the correct results.
